## py5 Classes and Other Tools

### Classes

* [Py5Graphics](/reference/py5graphics) - Main graphics and rendering context, as well as the base API implementation for Processing's â€œcoreâ€.
* [Py5Image](/reference/py5image) - A Datatype for storing images. Allows loading, converting and displaying external image formats as well as efficient manipulation of pixels as NumPy arrays.
* [Py5Shape](/reference/py5shape) - Datatype for storing shapes. Allows loading and displaying SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and OBJ shapes.
* [Py5Shader](/reference/py5shader) - This class encapsulates a GLSL shader program, including a vertex and a fragment shader.
* [Py5Surface](/reference/py5surface) - The Py5Surface object is the actual window py5 draws animations to. You can use this to interact with the window and change some of its characteristics, such as the window title or location.
* [Py5Font](/reference/py5font) - Py5Font is the font class for py5. To create a font to use with py5, use `create_font_file()`. This will create a font in the format py5 requires.
* [Py5MouseEvent](/reference/py5mouseevent) - A Py5MouseEvent object will be passed to user-defined mouse event functions. Useful for capturing all of a userâ€™s mouse activity.
* [Py5KeyEvent](/reference/py5keyevent) - A Py5MouseEvent object will be passed to user-defined mouse event functions. Useful for capturing all of a userâ€™s keyboard activity.
* [Py5Vector](/reference/py5vector) - Class to describe a 2D, 3D, or 4D vector. A vector is an entity that has both a magnitude and a direction. This datatype stores the components of the vector as a set of coordinates.

### Tools

* [Py5 Magics](/reference/py5magics) - The py5 Magics are Jupyter Notebook â€œmeta-commandsâ€ that can be within Jupyter Notebooks to enhance py5â€™s ability to work within the notebook.

* [Py5 Tools](/reference/py5tools) - The py5 Tools are extra utility functions not directly related to creating Sketches that help facilitate the use of py5. For example, you can use these to add jar files to the Java classpath before importing py5.
* [Py5 Functions](/reference/py5functions) - The py5 Functions are extra utility functions that make py5 easier to use. For example, you can use these to Processingâ€™s vlw font files without having to use Processingâ€™s IDE.
